  text: General
  rules:
  - rule: rule_turn
    text: A {term:turn} is a duration of time during which a player may take actions and is the first to receive priority to act during priority windows.
  - rule: rule_corp_turn_phases
    text: |-
      The Corp's turn consists of three phases. During the {term: draw phase}, the Corp draws the top card of R&D into HQ; during the {term: action phase}, the Corp spends [click]s to perform actions; during the {term: discard phase}, the Corp discards until the number of cards in HQ does not exceed their maximum hand size. Once the Corp's turn ends, the Runner's turn begins.
  - rule: rule_runner_turn_phases
    text: |-
      The Runner's turn consists of two phases. During the {term: action phase}, the Runner spends [click]s to perform actions; during the {term: discard phase}, the Runner discards until the number of cards in their grip does not exceed their maximum hand size. Once the Runner's turn ends, the Corp's turn begins.
  - subsection: rule_begin_end_turn_step
    text: The beginning and end of each player's turn are formalized as particular steps of the turn timing structures.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_turn_begin_trigger_conditions
      text: Trigger conditions related to a turn beginning are not met as the turn timing structure opens. They are met at the timing step that indicates the formal beginning of the turn.
    - rule: rule_turn_end_trigger_conditions
      text: Trigger conditions related to a turn or discard phase ending are met at the timing step that indicates the formal end of the turn. They are not met when the turn timing structure later closes. The end of the turn and the end of the discard phase are the same.
    - rule: rule_before_turn_begins
      text: Some effects can occur before the "turn begins" step or after the "turn ends" step of a turn. The player whose turn timing structure is in progress is still the active player, and effects that apply during their turn are still applicable, even though their turn has not yet formally begun or has already formally ended.
    - rule: rule_never_between_turns
      text: Once the game begins, it is always one or the other player's turn. There is no time "between turns".
      
- section: sec_actions
  text: Actions
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_action_definition
    text: |-
      An {term:action} is any paid ability where the cost begins with a [click] symbol.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_costs_with_click
      text: Other costs can contain [click] symbols without denoting an action.
      examples: 
      - text: |-
          The ability "[click]: Gain 1[c] and draw 1 card." on {card:Professional Contacts} is an action. The ability "Lose [click]: Break 1 subroutine on this ice. Only the Runner can use this ability." on {card:Eli 1.0} is not an action and is used during a paid ability window.
  - subsection: rule_initiate_action
    text: A player initiates an action by paying its cost in [click], as well as any other costs associated with that action, during their action window.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_action_completion
      text: Once an action is initiated, it must be completed before the game can advance to the next step or open another action window. If the effects of an action initiate a timing structure, such as a run, players may use paid abilities, rez cards, and score agendas as dictated by the priority windows of that nested timing structure, but otherwise players cannot perform any of those voluntary effects while the action is resolving. See {ref:sec_timing_and_priority} for more details about priority.
    - rule: rule_action_timing_structure_completion
      text: If a timing structure is initiated during the resolution of an action, that action is not complete until the new timing structure is complete and any further effects of the initiated action following the completion of the new timing structure are resolved.
      examples: 
      - text: The Runner takes the action "play an event", playing {card:Stimhack}. The action is not complete until the run initiated by {card:Stimhack} ends, the Runner suffers core damage, and {card:Stimhack} is trashed following its resolution.
    - rule: rule_action_conditional_ability_trigger
      text: A conditional ability that meets its trigger condition due to a player taking an action resolves after the action's trigger cost is paid, before the effects of the action itself. See {ref:rule_chain_reaction}.
    - rule: rule_finish_action_trigger_condition
      text: Some conditional abilities meet their trigger conditions due to an action "ending", "finishing", or "completing". These abilities resolve in the reaction window following {ref:step_corp_turn_action} or {ref:step_runner_turn_action}, for actions taken by the Corp and Runner, respectively.
  - subsection: rule_basic_actions
    text: Each player has several basic actions they can always perform. The Corp's basic actions are listed in {ref:rule_corp_actions}, and the Runner's basic actions are listed in {ref:rule_runner_actions}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_with_the_basic_action
      text: If an ability has a trigger condition related to an effect being performed “with the basic action”, that trigger condition is met by any basic action that performs the indicated effect. If an ability imposes a cost on performing an effect “with the basic action”, that cost applies to any instance of the indicated effect that would occur as part of resolving a basic action.
  - rule: rule_actions_outside_action_phase
    text: A player can only take actions during the action phase of their turn. If an effect directs a player to take an action outside of that player's action phase, instead that player does nothing.
  - subsection: rule_same_different_actions
    text: Some cards refer to players taking "the same action" or "different actions".
    rules:
    - rule: rule_same_actions
      text: Actions a player performs are the same if they are all the same basic action or if all of those actions were initiated by the same ability from the same card.
    - rule: rule_defferent_actions
      text: Actions a player performs are different if each of them is initiated from a different basic action or card ability. Instances of equivalent abilities on different cards are still different actions.
      examples: 
      - text: |-
          The Corp, playing {card:MirrorMorph: Endless Iteration}, plays {card:Hedge Fund} as the first action of their turn, then plays {card:Lateral Growth}. Even though two different cards were played, both times the Corp used the basic action to "Play 1 operation from HQ". Since their first two actions were the same, the Corp will not be able to trigger the ability on MirrorMorph this turn.
  - subsection: rule_corp_actions
    text: Corp Actions
    rules:
    - rule: rule_corp_basic_actions
      text: |-

- section: sec_draw_phase
  text: Draw Phase
  rules:

  - rule: rule_mandatory_draw
    text: |-
        The {term:mandatory draw} is a card draw performed by the Corp. It is not an action and does not cost [click].
  - rule: rule_no_runner_draw_phase
    text: The Runner's turn does not have a draw phase.
- section: sec_action_phase
  text: Action Phase
  rules:
  - rule: rule_action_phase_definition
    text: The action phase is the first phase of the Runner's turn and the second phase of the Corp's turn. It is the only timing structure in which players can take actions, as discussed in {ref:sec_actions}.
  - rule: rule_action_phase_duration
    text: During a player's action phase, they must continue to take actions until they have no more clicks or the phase is ended directly by a card ability. The player may take actions in any combination and order as long as they pay the appropriate costs. Once they have no remaining clicks, the action phase ends.
  - subsection: rule_forced_action_phase_end
    text: |-
      A player's action phase can be forced to end by certain card abilities (e.g. via the ability on a {subtype: terminal} operation or event). When a player's action phase is forced to end, the following occurs:
    rules:
    - rule: rule_terminal_step_ends
      text: The current step of the action phase ends, and all remaining steps are skipped.
    - rule: rule_terminal_priority_windows_close
      text: Any currently open priority windows close, their associated abilities lose their pending status, and the player with priority loses priority.
    - rule: rule_terminal_completion
      text: Any currently resolving actions or abilities cease resolving and are considered complete.
    - rule: rule_terminal_checkpoint
      new:
      text: Conditions related to the action phase ending are met, and a checkpoint occurs. A reaction window created by this checkpoint is still considered to be taking place in the action phase, but players cannot take actions during this window.

    text: If an effect attempts to end a player's action phase during their draw phase, their discard phase, or another player's turn, this effect does nothing.
- section: sec_discard_phase
  text: Discard Phase
  rules:
  - rule: rule_discard_phase_definition

  - subsection: rule_max_hand_size
    text: |-

    rules:
    - rule: rule_max_hand_size_default
      text: Players begin the game with a maximum hand size of five cards.
    - rule: rule_max_hand_size_core_damage
      text: Each point of core damage the Runner suffers permanently reduces their maximum hand size by 1 card. See {ref:sec_damage}. Other abilities can modify a player's maximum hand size directly.
  - subsection: rule_discard_step
    text: The {term:discard step} is {ref:step_corp_turn_discard} for the Corp, and {ref:step_runner_turn_discard} for the Runner. In that step, the active player discards cards to reach their maximum hand size.
    new:
    rules:
    - rule: rule_runner_discard_step
      text: Before the Runner discards cards in their discard step, they must check for a flatline. See {ref:rule_flatline}.
