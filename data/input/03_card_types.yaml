text: Card Types
sections:
- section: sec_identities
  text: Identities
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_identity_play_area
    text: Each player starts the game with a single identity active in the play area. See {ref:sec_starting_the_game}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_identity_double_sided
      text: |-
        Some identities are double-sided. Only the front side of a double-sided identity will have values for its minimum deck size and influence limit. Only the side of a double-sided identity that is currently faceup is active at any given time.
    - rule: rule_identity_not_installed 
      text: Identities are not installed.
  - rule: rule_identity_deck_size_influence
    text: |-
      Only identity cards have minimum deck sizes and influence limits. These values do not apply during the game; instead, they determine deckbuilding constraints for decks associated with that identity. See {ref:sec_deck_construction}.
  - rule: rule_identity_base_link
    text: Only Runner identities have a base link. This value is used in calculating the Runner's link value. See {ref:sec_link}.
  - rule: rule_identity_HQ
    text: The Corp's identity card is used to mark the location of HQ. See {ref:subsec_hq}.

- section: sec_agendas
  text: Agendas
  snippet: Agendas represent valuable pieces of Corporate data. When the Corp advances and scores agendas, it represents completion of critical Corporate projects. When the Runner steals agendas, it represents their acquisition of secret Corporate data.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_agendas_in_roots
    text: The Corp may install agendas only in the roots of remote servers. There can be only one agenda or one asset installed in the root of any given remote server at a time. See {ref:subsec_remote_servers}.
  - subsection: rule_agenda_advancement_requirement_agenda_points
    text: Only agendas have advancement requirements and agenda points. See {ref:sec_score_scoring_steal}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_agenda_advancement_requirement
      text: An agenda's advancement requirement is the minimum number of advancement counters that must be on that agenda for the Corp to score it.
    - rule: rule_score_from_score_area
      text: The agenda points on an agenda contribute to a player's score while the agenda is in their score area.
  - subsection: rule_agendas_not_rezzed
    text: Agendas cannot be rezzed and are inactive while installed. Agendas are active in the Corp's score area. Agendas are inactive in the Runner's score area unless the agenda's card text specifies otherwise. See {ref:sec_score_area}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_agendas_faceup
      text: Some agendas may be installed faceup or turned faceup through card abilities. Faceup agendas are neither rezzed nor unrezzed. If an agenda's printed text directs the Corp to install it faceup, that agenda's abilities are active while it is installed.
    - rule: rule_advancemenet_requirements_modification
      text: Some agendas modify the requirements for stealing or scoring them. These abilities are always active, according to any restrictions or requirements specified. See {ref:rule_ability_active_inactive_source_card}.
  - rule: rule_agendas_advanced
    text: Agendas can always be advanced. See {ref:sec_advancing_cards}.

- section: sec_assets
  text: Assets
  snippet: Assets represent various resources and connections at the Corp's disposal.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_asset_root_remote
    text: The Corp may install assets only in the roots of remote servers. There can be only one agenda or one asset installed in the root of any given remote server at a time. See {ref:subsec_remote_servers}.
  - rule: rule_asset_rez_cost
    text: Assets are among the card types that have rez costs. They are installed unrezzed and remain inactive until the Corp rezzes them by paying their rez costs during a paid ability window. See {ref:sec_faceup_facedown_status}.
  - rule: rule_asset_trash_cost
    text: Assets are among the card types that have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an asset, they may pay the trash cost to trash that asset. See {ref:rule_basic_trash_ability}.
  - rule: rule_asset_lady_liberty
    text: One asset, {card:Lady Liberty}, has the subtype {subtype:region} and the text "Limit 1 {subtype:region} per server." See {ref:subsec_regions} for rules governing {subtype:region} cards.

- section: sec_ice
  text: Ice
  snippet: Ice are sophisticated security systems that protect Corporate servers through a variety of means. "Ice" has been suggested to stand for a variety of expressions, but is most commonly expanded as "Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics".
  rules:
  - rule: rule_ice_piece_of_ice
    text: |-
      "Ice" and "piece of ice" are synonymous.
  - subsection: rule_ice_install
    text: Ice are the only type of card installed protecting servers. Ice are not installed in the roots of servers. See {ref:subsec_protecting_a_server}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_layout
      text: Ice protecting a server are laid out horizontally in front of that server, with the outermost piece of ice furthest from the server.
    - rule: rule_ice_instal_outermost
      text: When the Corp installs a piece of ice, they must install it in the outermost position protecting a server. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.
  - subsection: rule_ice_rez_cost
    text: Ice are among the card types that have rez costs. They are installed unrezzed and remain inactive until the Corp rezzes them by paying their rez costs. See {ref:sec_faceup_facedown_status}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_rez_window
      text: Unlike assets and upgrades, ice can normally only be rezzed while being approached during a run. See {ref:sec_approach_ice_phase}.
  - subsection: rule_ice_strength_value
    text: Ice are among the card types that have strength. An ice's strength determines which icebreakers are allowed to interface with it. See {ref:subsec_icebreakers}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_strength_modification_duration
      text: If an ability modifies the strength of a piece of ice for the remainder of a run, and that ability resolves during an encounter outside of a run, the modification instead lasts for the remainder of that encounter.
      examples:
      - text: |-
          The Runner accesses and encounters an {card:Archangel} in HQ with {card:Gang Sign}. The Runner uses {card:Devil Charm} to lower the strength of {card:Archangel}. That strength reduction would normally last for the remainder of the current run, but since no run is in progress, it instead lasts for the remainder of the encounter.
  - subsection: rule_ice_trash_cost
    text: Some ice have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an ice with a trash cost, they may pay the trash cost to trash that ice. See {ref:rule_basic_trash_ability}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_access
      text: Unlike assets, upgrades, and agendas, ice are not normally accessed while installed. Encountering a piece of ice does not entail accessing that ice and does not give the Runner an opportunity to pay its trash cost.
  - rule: rule_ice_install_cost
    text: Ice are the only Corp cards with install costs. The install cost of a piece of ice is not a printed value but instead a calculated value based on the number of other ice already protecting the relevant server. See {ref:rule_install_cost}.
  - rule: rule_ice_subroutine
    text: Ice are the only cards with subroutines. See {ref:sec_subroutines}.

- section: sec_operations
  text: Operations
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_operation_play
    text: Operations are the only Corp cards that are played. Operations are never installed. Playing an operation causes its abilities to become active, and once those abilities are fully resolved the operation is trashed. See {ref:sec_playing_events_and_operations}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_operation_condition
      text: Some operations have the subtype {subtype:condition}. As part of their abilities, {subtype:condition} operations convert themselves into {subtype:condition} counters and install themselves. A {subtype:condition} operation cannot be installed by an install effect; it can only be installed through its own conversion ability. See {ref:rule_card_to_counter}.
    - rule: rule_operation_current
      text: Some operations have the subtype {subtype:current}. As part of their abilities, {subtype:current} operations prevent themselves from being trashed until another {subtype:current} operation or event is played or the Runner steals an agenda. When one of these occurs, the active {subtype:current} is trashed during the next checkpoint. See {ref:rule_play_not_trashed_until}.
    - rule: rule_operation_lockdown
      text: Some operations have the subtype {subtype:lockdown}. As part of their abilities, {subtype:lockdown} operations prevent themselves from being trashed until the start of the Corp's next turn after the operation is played. Once the Corp's turn begins, this effect expires and the operation is trashed during the next checkpoint, before any conditional abilities marked pending at that time can be triggered. See {ref:rule_play_not_trashed_until}.
  - rule: rule_operation_play_cost
    text: Operations are the only Corp cards with play costs. An operation's play cost is the number of credits the Corp must spend to play the operation. See {ref:sec_playing_events_and_operations}.
  - rule: rule_operation_trash_cost
    text: Some operations have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an operation with a trash cost, they may pay the trash cost to trash that operation. See {ref:rule_basic_trash_ability}.

- section: sec_upgrades
  text: Upgrades
  rules:
  - rule: rule_upgrade_install
    text: The Corp may install upgrades in the root of any server. Upgrades are the only card type that can be installed in the root of a central server.
  - rule: rule_upgrade_no_limit
    text: There is no limit to the number of upgrades that can be installed in the root of a single server.
  - rule: rule_upgrade_rez_cost
    text: Upgrades are among the card types that have rez costs. They are installed unrezzed and remain inactive until the Corp rezzes them by paying their rez costs during a paid ability window. See {ref:sec_faceup_facedown_status}.
  - rule: rule_upgrade_trash_cost
    text: Upgrades are among the card types that have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an upgrade, they may pay the trash cost to trash that upgrade. See {ref:rule_basic_trash_ability}.
  - subsection: subsec_regions
    text: Regions
    toc:
    rules:
    - rule: rule_upgrade_region
      text: Some upgrades have the subtype {subtype:region}. All {subtype:regions} have the text "Limit 1 {subtype:region} per server."
    - rule: rule_region_one_root
      text: The {subtype:region} limitation applies only to cards with the subtype {subtype:region} that are installed or in the process of being installed in the root of a server. It does not apply to cards in central servers, and it does not apply to ice.
    - rule: rule_region_active_inactive
      text: The {subtype:region} limitation applies to all cards as specified in {ref:rule_region_one_root}, regardless of the active or inactive state of those cards.
    - rule: rule_region_install
      text: When the Corp installs a card with the subtype {subtype:region} into the root of a server that already has a {subtype:region}, they must trash the already-installed {subtype:region}. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.
    - rule: rule_region_swap
      text: The Corp cannot swap a {subtype:region} card with a non-{subtype:region} card in another location if there is another {subtype:region} card already installed in the destination location.

- section: sec_events
  text: Events
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_event_play
    text: Events are the only Runner cards that are played. Events are never installed. Playing an event causes its abilities to become active, and once those abilities are fully resolved the event is trashed. See {ref:sec_playing_events_and_operations}.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_event_condition
      text: One event, {card:On the Lam}, has the subtype {subtype:condition}. As part of its abilities, it converts itself into a condition counter and installs itself. This event cannot be installed by an install effect; it can only be installed through its own conversion ability. See {ref:rule_card_to_counter}.
    - rule: rule_event_current
      text: Some events have the subtype {subtype:current}. As part of their abilities, {subtype:current} events prevent themselves from being trashed until another {subtype:current} operation or event is played or the Corp scores an agenda. When one of these occurs, the active {subtype:current} is trashed during the next checkpoint. See {ref:rule_play_not_trashed_until}.
  - rule: rule_event_play_cost
    text: Events are the only Runner cards with play costs. An event's play cost is the number of credits the Runner must spend to play the event. See {ref:sec_playing_events_and_operations}.

- section: sec_hardware
  text: Hardware
  snippet: |-
    The Runner's hardware are the physical tools at their disposal: the computers, chips, and other machinery that make up their rig.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_hardware_piece_of_hardware
    text: |-
      "Hardware" and "piece of hardware" are synonymous.
  - rule: rule_hardware_install
    text: The Runner installs hardware into the play area.
  - rule: rule_hardware_install_cost
    text: Hardware are among the types of cards with install costs. The Runner installs a hardware faceup and active by paying its install cost. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.
  - rule: rule_hardware_no_limit
    text: There is no limit to the number of hardware the Runner can have installed.
  - subsection: subsec_consoles
    text: Consoles
    toc:
    rules:
    - rule: rule_hardware_console
      text: Some hardware have the subtype {subtype:console}. All {subtype:consoles} have the text "Limit 1 {subtype:console} per player."
    - rule: rule_install_console
      text: If a player ever controls more than one installed {subtype:console}, all but the most recently active {subtype:console} are trashed. Trashing cards this way cannot be prevented.
    - rule: rule_console_limitation
      text: This limitation applies only to hardware with the subtype {subtype:console}.
    - rule: rule_console_limitation_active
      text: This limitation applies only to active {subtype:console}. A player can have multiple copies of a {subtype:console}, and even different {subtype:consoles}, in their deck.

- section: sec_programs
  text: Programs
  snippet: Programs are digital tools at the Runner's disposal, primarily used as a means of intrusion.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_program_install
    text: The Runner installs programs into the play area.
  - rule: rule_program_install_cost
    text: Programs are among the types of cards with install costs. The Runner installs a program faceup and active by paying its install cost. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.
  - subsection: rule_program_memory_cost
    text: Programs are the only card type that have a memory cost. A program's memory cost is the number of memory units that program requires while it is installed.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_program_memory
      text: Installing a program does not permanently consume memory. The program claims its designated quantity of memory units until it becomes uninstalled, at which point those memory units become available for use by other programs.
    - rule: rule_program_install_exceed_memory_limit
      text: When the Runner installs a program that would increase the total memory cost of installed programs over their memory limit, they must trash one or more installed programs such that the total memory cost of installed programs including the new program will not exceed their memory limit. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.
    - rule: rule_program_other_exceed_memory_limit
      text: If the Runner's memory limit decreases below the total memory cost of installed programs, or if the total memory cost of installed programs increases above the memory limit for any reason other than installing another program, the Runner must trash one or more installed programs such that the total memory cost of the remaining programs does not exceed their memory limit. This occurs during the next checkpoint after the memory limit is exceeded. See {ref:sec_checkpoints}.
    - rule: rule_program_memory_not_a_cost
      text: A program's memory cost is not a cost. It cannot be increased, lowered, ignored, or otherwise modified by abilities that affect costs to install programs.
  - subsection: rule_program_strength_value
    text: Programs are among the card types that have strength.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_icebreakers_strength_value
      text: Programs with the subtype {subtype:icebreaker} have a printed numerical strength value. An {subtype:icebreaker}'s strength determines which ice it is allowed to interface with. See {ref:subsec_icebreakers}.
    - rule: rule_programs_without_strength_value
      text: Programs without the subtype {subtype:icebreaker} do not have a strength value. A dash (–) is printed on non-{subtype:icebreaker} program cards in the place where strength is printed on {subtype:icebreaker} program cards.
  - subsection: subsec_icebreakers
    text: Icebreakers
    toc:
    rules:
    - rule: rule_program_icebreaker
      text: Some programs have the subtype {subtype:icebreaker}. {subtype:Icebreaker} programs have strength and abilities that interface with ice.
    - rule: rule_icebreaker_strength_increase_implicit
      text: Paid abilities on an {subtype:icebreaker} that modify that {subtype:icebreaker}'s strength implicitly have a duration of "for the remainder of the current encounter".
      examples:
      - text: |-
          {card:Corroder} has the ability "1[c]: +1 strength."" Since no duration is specified, this strength increase applies until the end of the current encounter.
    - rule: rule_icebreaker_strength_increase_specified
      text: If an {subtype:icebreaker}'s paid ability specifies another duration for modifying its strength, that modification lasts until both the stated duration and the implicit encounter duration have expired.
      examples:
      - text: |-
          {card:Gordian Blade} has the ability "1[c]: +1 strength for the remainder of this run." This ability applies until the end of the current run, whether it is triggered during an encounter or another step of the run. If the ability is triggered during an encounter that takes place outside of a run, the strength increase applies for the duration of that encounter.
    - rule: rule_icebreaker_strength_increase_outside_of_encounter
      text: If an {subtype:icebreaker}'s paid ability modifies its strength outside of an encounter and does not specify another applicable duration, the modification expires during the next checkpoint.
      examples:
      - text: If the Runner uses {card:Corroder}'s ability to increase its strength outside of an encounter, it applies only until the next checkpoint.
    - rule: rule_icebreaker_interface
      text: All {subtype:icebreakers} have abilities that {term:interface} with ice, sometimes referred to as "interface abilities". These abilities are indicated by the "interface" flag preceding the ability's text.
    - rule: rule_icebreaker_interface_during_encounter
      text: The Runner can only use an interface ability during {ref:step_encounter_paw} of an encounter, and can only choose the encountered piece of ice and its subroutines as targets for the ability's effects. See {ref:sec_targets} for more information about targeting.
    - rule: rule_icebreaker_interface_strength
      text: The Runner can only use an interface ability on an {subtype:icebreaker} if the {subtype:icebreaker} has strength greater than or equal to the strength of the encountered ice.
    - rule: rule_icebreaker_interface_subtype
      text: If an interface ability specifies that it affects a particular subtype of ice, then that ability can only be used on a piece of ice that has the specified subtype. If an ability on an {subtype:icebreaker} does not specify a subtype of ice that it affects, that ability can be used on any piece of ice.

- section: sec_resources
  text: Resources
  snippet: Resources are a wide variety of connections and skills that aid the Runner.
  rules:
  - rule: rule_resource_install
    text: The Runner installs resources into the play area.
  - rule: rule_resource_install_cost
    text: Resources are among the types of cards with install costs. The Runner installs a resource faceup and active by paying its install cost. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.
  - rule: rule_resource_no_limit
    text: There is no limit to the number of resources the Runner can have installed.
  - rule: rule_resource_trash_action
    text: While the Runner is tagged, the Corp may spend [click] and 2[c] to trash an installed resource as a basic action. See {ref:sec_tags}.
