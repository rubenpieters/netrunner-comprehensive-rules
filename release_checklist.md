# Release Checklist

Series of steps to go over before releasing, ensuring no mistake creeps into these areas that could be forgotten.

* Check that all new highlighting has been applied to new changes.
* Check that timing structures in appendix match any changes made in the rules, if applicable.
* Verify that effective date is correct.
* Check the hosted PHP version and everything looks fine there, as it is generated differently from the html version for local testing.
* Check there's no leftover new highlighting or changelog entries from previous release.
