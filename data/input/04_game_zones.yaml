    rules:
    - rule: rule_zone_types
      text: |-
        There are 8 zone types: deck, hand, discard pile, score area, play area, bank, set aside, and removed from the game.
    - rule: rule_player_zones
      text: Each player has their own deck, hand, discard pile, and score area. All players share the play area, the bank, the set-aside zone, and the removed-from-game zone.
    - rule: rule_card_in_one_zone
      text: Each card in the game exists in exactly 1 zone at a time.
  - subsection: rule_move_between_zones
    text: Game rules and card effects can move cards and counters between zones. See {ref:sec_card_movements} for rules on card movements.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_reveal_from_hidden
      text: If a facedown card or a card in a hidden zone would ever move to another zone as part of an effect that requires that card to have a specific attribute, that card must be revealed before being moved to the new zone. If the card is being installed, this rule only applies as indicated by {ref:rule_install_from_hidden_or_secret_zone}.
      examples:
      - text: When resolving {card:Clone Suffrage Movement}, the Corp chooses a facedown {card:Fast Break} in Archives. The Corp must reveal the {card:Fast Break} before adding it to HQ, to demonstrate that it is indeed an operation, meeting {card:Clone Suffrage Movement}'s requirement.
    - rule: rule_move_instantaneous
      text: When a card is moved from one zone to another, the move is instantaneous. The card is never in both zones at once, and it is never not in any zone at all.
  - rule: rule_outside_game
    text: A card that is not in any zone is outside the game. Cards outside of the game are distinct from cards in the removed-from-game zone, and cannot affect the game. They can only be affected by abilities that explicitly bring in extra cards from outside the game. See {ref:sec_extra_cards}.

    snippet: The grip represents the Runner's currently accessible thoughts, plans, knowledge, potential social connections, and other intangible information that can be leveraged.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_grip_name
      text: The {term:grip} is the name for the Runner's hand.
    - rule: rule_grip_damage
      text: Suffering damage forces the Runner to discard cards from their grip at random, and suffering core damage also reduces the Runner's maximum hand size. The Runner flatlines and loses the game if they suffer more damage than they have cards in grip or must discard down to a hand size lower than zero. See {ref:sec_damage}.

- section: sec_discard_pile
  text: Discard Pile
  rules:

  - rule: rule_play_area_card_open_info
    text: Whether or not a card itself and its attributes are open information while in the play area is determined by the card's status. Cards that are faceup are open information and can be examined by any player at any time. Cards that are facedown are secret information and can only be examined by the player who controls the card. See {ref:sec_information}.
  - subsection: rule_play_area_active_inactive

    - rule: rule_play_area_counters
      text: Counters other than credits have no specific location in the play area. Tag counters are always controlled by the Runner, and bad publicity counters are always controlled by the Corp. Other types of counters are either nonfunctional gameplay aids or appear only in host relationships. See also {ref:sec_counters_and_tokens}.
    - rule: rule_play_area_installed_hosted
      text: Some cards can act as install locations for other cards while in the play area, such that cards of a specific type can be hosted directly onto them during the installation process. In this type of host relationship, both the host card and the hosted card are in the play area, but the host relationship can affect certain aspects of either the card or the installation process. See {ref:sec_host}.
    - rule: rule_play_area_not_installed_hosted
      text: Some cards can host other cards without installing them. In this type of host relationship, both the host card and the hosted card are in the play area, but the hosted card is not installed and thus not active. See {ref:sec_host}.

  - subsection: subsec_servers
    text: Servers
    toc:
    rules:
    - rule: rule_server
      text: A {term:server} is a set of locations where the Corp installs their cards into the play area and against which the Runner can initiate runs. Whenever a Corp installs an agenda, asset, ice, or upgrade, they must choose a destination server for that card. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.
    - rule: rule_corp_cards_cannot_be_moved
      text: Once a Corp card is installed, it cannot be moved from its server without explicit direction from a game rule or card effect.
    - rule: rule_server_types
      text: The two types of servers are central servers and remote servers. See {ref:subsec_central_servers,subsec_remote_servers}, respectively.
    - rule: rule_server_ice
      text: All servers can have ice installed protecting them. See {ref:subsec_protecting_a_server}.
    - rule: rule_server_root
      text: All servers have a {term:root} where cards can be installed. A central server's root can contain any number of upgrades, while a remote server's root can contain 1 asset or agenda and any number of upgrades. Assets and agendas cannot be installed in the root of a central server.
    - rule: rule_server_root_order
      text: All cards installed in the root of a server are kept in the same orientation and location together. The order in which the cards are installed is open information, but the type of cards installed in the root of a remote server should not be derivable from their orientation or location.
    - rule: rule_region_unique
      text: Only 1 {subtype:region} upgrade can be installed in the root of a server at a time. See {ref:subsec_regions}.
    - rule: rule_upgrade_server_restriction
      text: Some upgrades have restrictions limiting them to specific servers. See {ref:rule_x_server_only}.
    - rule: rule_this_server
      text: Some cards refer to the server where they are located (or the central server corresponding to the zone where they are located) using the phrase "this server". If an ability is initiated by a trigger condition or cost involving the ability's source card moving from a server, its root, or protecting it to another server or to a location not associated with any server, treat "this server" as referring to the server associated with the previous location of the card throughout resolution of that ability. If an ability moves its source card while it is resolving, continue to interpret "this server" based on the card's previous location.
      examples:
      - text: The Runner trashes a rezzed {card:Warroid Tracker}. This meets the trigger condition of {card:Warroid Tracker}'s ability, but by the time a checkpoint is resolved and an instance of the ability would become pending, {card:Warroid Tracker} itself is no longer installed. The use of "this server" in the trigger condition still refers to the server from which {card:Warroid Tracker} was trashed, not to the server of {card:Warroid Tracker}'s new location in Archives.
      - text: The Corp uses the ability granted by {card:ZATO City Grid} to trash {card:Border Control} and resolve its first subroutine. The phrase "this server" in that subroutine refers to the server from which the {card:Border Control} was trashed. However, {card:Border Control} is no longer protecting that server, so it is not included in the number of ice counted.
      - text: The Corp uses {card:Nanisivik Grid} to turn a facedown {card:Border Control} in Archives faceup and resolve its first subroutine. {card:Border Control} was not moved between servers, so "this server" in that subroutine refers to Archives.
    - rule: rule_another_server
      text: If an ability on a card currently or previously located in a server, its root, or protecting it  refers to "another server", this means any server except "this server" as interpreted by {ref:rule_this_server}. If a card's abilities involve choosing a server, "another server" in a linked ability means any server except the chosen server. If neither of the previous cases apply and a run is in progress, "another server" means any server except the attacked server.

  - subsection: subsec_central_servers
    text: Central Servers
    toc:
    rules:
    - rule: rule_three_central_servers
      text: |-
        The Corp has three {term:central servers} at all times. Each central server corresponds to one of the Corp's zones: HQ corresponds to the Corp's hand, R&D corresponds to the Corp's deck, and Archives corresponds to the Corp's discard pile.
    - rule: rule_hq_identity
      text: The Corp's identity is in the play area to indicate the location of HQ relative to other servers, but it is not in HQ, in the root of HQ, or protecting HQ. The cards in HQ are held in the Corp's hand. The upgrades installed in the root of HQ are placed in a vertical orientation near the Corp's identity. The ice installed protecting HQ are placed in a horizontal orientation in front of the Corp's identity outwards towards the Runner.
    - rule: rule_rnd_deck
      text: The Corp's deck is placed in the play area to indicate the location of R&D relative to other servers, but the cards in the deck are not installed.

The ice installed protecting R&D are placed in a horizontal orientation in front of the deck outwards towards the Runner.
    - rule: rule_archives_discard_pile
      text: The Corp's discard pile is placed in the play area to indicate the location of Archives relative to other servers, but the cards in the discard pile are not installed. The cards in Archives are the cards in the discard pile. The upgrades installed in the root of Archives are placed in a vertical orientation near the discard pile.

    - rule: rule_creating_remote_servers
      text: The Corp starts the game with no remote servers. The Corp creates a new remote server by declaring it as the destination server for a card they are about to install. There is no limit to the number of remote servers the Corp can have at any given time.
    - rule: rule_separate_remote_servers
      text: Cards installed in the roots of separate remote servers are placed in a vertical orientation in a row extending away from the central servers to indicate the locations of the remote servers relative to other servers. The ice installed protecting each remote server are placed in a horizontal orientation in front of any cards in the root of that server, outwards towards the Runner.
    - rule: rule_remote_server_existence
      text: A remote server exists as long as there is at least one card in the root of or protecting it. A remote server can be made up of only ice protecting it, only cards installed in it, or a combination of both.
    - rule: rule_remote_server_cease_to_exist
      text: During checkpoints, a remote server ceases to exist if there are no cards installed in its root and no cards installed protecting it. If a server ceases to exist during a run against it, then the run ends after any currently open paid ability window closes. Unless the run has already been declared either successful or unsuccessful, it is neither. See {ref:rule_server_ceases_to_exist}.
    - rule: rule_limit_remote_servers
      text: |-
        The Corp card {card:Earth Station: SEA Headquarters} and its reverse, {card:Earth Station: Ascending to Orbit}, both have the ability, "Limit 1 remote server." While this ability is active, as long as a remote server exists, the Corp cannot create a new remote server. If at any time more than 1 remote server exists while this ability is active, the next checkpoint will force the Corp player to choose 1 of those servers. The checkpoint will then trash all cards in the root of and protecting each other remote server. See {ref:rule_checkpoint_card_restrictions}.

  - subsection: subsec_protecting_a_server
    text: Protecting a Server
    toc:
    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_ordered
      text: An installed piece of ice is arranged in a horizontal position in front of the server it is protecting. Ice are ordered within the play area. The location of a piece of ice is defined by the server it is protecting and the number of other pieces of ice between it and the server.
    - rule: rule_innermost_ice
      text: If there is no other ice between the server and a piece of ice, that ice is the innermost piece of ice. If there is no ice farther from the server than a piece of ice, that ice is the outermost piece of ice. If there is only one piece of ice protecting a server, that ice is both the innermost and the outermost piece of ice.
    - rule: rule_ice_same_position
      text: If two pieces of ice protecting two different servers share the same number of ice between them and their respective servers, those pieces of ice are considered to be in the same position.
    - rule: rule_ice_install_outermost
      text: When the Corp installs a piece of ice protecting a server, they must place it in the outermost position protecting that server. See {ref:sec_install_uninstall}.
    - rule: rule_ice_move
      text: If the number of other ice between a piece of ice and the server changes, its position will change accordingly, moving either closer or farther from the server. If this occurs while that ice is being approached, encountered, or passed during a run, the Runner's position attacking the server changes in the same way.

- section: sec_bank
  text: Bank
  rules:
  - rule: rule_bank_counter_supply
    text: The {term:bank} is an inactive zone shared by both players. It holds an unlimited supply of counters for use during gameplay.
  - rule: rule_counters_default_from_bank

    text: If an object is "set aside", it is moved from its current zone to the set-aside zone.
  - rule: rule_set_aside_zone_passthrough
    text: An ability cannot see the set-aside zone unless it specifically sets objects aside or refers to set-aside objects. Outside of these cases, cards moved into another zone from the set-aside zone are treated as though they entered that zone directly from their location prior to being set aside.
    examples:
    - text: The Runner is playing as {card:Exile} and plays Test Run, searching their heap for a program. Although the program is set aside before being installed, {card:Exile}'s ability treats it as though it were installed directly from the heap, and so {card:Exile} will draw a card.
  - rule: rule_searched_cards_set_aside
    text: Cards found during a search are set aside facedown while the search completes (in particular, while any deck that was searched is shuffled). See {ref:sec_searching_cards}.
  - rule: rule_set_aside_hosted_counters_trash_ability
    text: Some paid abilities with a trigger cost that uninstalls or forfeits the ability's source card need to refer to or act on that card's hosted cards or counters. These abilities set aside the hosted cards or counters as the trigger cost is paid. See {ref:rule_trash_ability_keeps_track_of_hosted_objects}.
  - rule: rule_set_aside_default_faceup
    text: Cards set aside by a card ability are faceup unless the ability specifically instructs that they be set aside facedown.
  - rule: rule_facedown_set_aside_distinct_groups
    text: Facedown cards in the set-aside zone must be kept in distinct groups according to the effect that sets them aside. Cards within such a group are not ordered and can be freely arranged by their controller.
    examples:
    - text: The Runner accesses the top card of R&D and does not steal or trash it. On the next turn, the Corp uses {card:Daily Business Show} to draw that card and 1 other card simultaneously, but must put 1 of the drawn cards on the bottom of R&D. While resolving the draw, the cards are set aside facedown, so the Corp can shuffle them. They do not have to tell the Runner whether the previously-accessed card ends up in HQ or on the bottom of R&D.
