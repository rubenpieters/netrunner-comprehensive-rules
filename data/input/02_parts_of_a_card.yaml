      The play, install, or rez cost of a card is a number that appears in the top-left corner of most card types. Play and install costs appear within a large circular icon, while rez costs appear within a small octagonal icon.
  - rule: rule_paying_printed_costs
    text: |-
      Play, install, and rez costs on cards are all paid in credits. {ref:chpt_card_manipulation} details how cards are played, installed, and rezzed.

    rules:
    - rule: rule_ice_have_install_costs_too
      text: |-
        Ice also has an install cost, but it does not appear on the card. The install cost of ice is determined by the configuration of other installed ice rather than being intrinsic to the card. See {ref:rule_install_cost}.

  text: Starting Memory Limit
  rules:
  - rule: rule_memory_limit_location
    text: |-
      Starting memory limit is a number appearing near the top-left of Runner identity cards, within the [MU] symbol.
  - rule: rule_memory_limit_citation

      {ref:Sec_deck_construction} details the rules for building a deck, including the requirement that out-of-faction cards in the deck adhere to the influence limit of the associated identity.

- section: sec_faction
  text: Faction Affiliation
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_faction_list
    text: |-
      Cards are divided into ten factions: four Corp factions, three Runner factions, and three Runner mini-factions. Factions and influence restrict deckbuilding options, allowing each faction to have distinct play differences from one another.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_corp_faction_list
      text: The Corp factions are Haas-Bioroid, Jinteki, NBN, and the Weyland Consortium.

  - rule: rule_faction_identification
    text: |-
      A card's faction can be identified by the color of its background, as well as a faction logo in one of its four corners. This logo also appears as a watermark behind the text box. If a card has a white background and no logo, it is neutral.
  - rule: rule_faction_citation
    text: |-
      Each identity is associated with one faction. {ref:sec_deck_construction} details how factions affect deckbuilding.

- section: sec_inf_cost
  text: Influence Cost
  rules:
  - rule: rule_inf_cost_location
    text: |-
      A card's influence cost, or influence value, is represented in a bar with 5 circular slots near the bottom of most cards. The influence cost is the number of slots that are filled with a blue circle, and can range from 0 to 5.
  - rule: rule_inf_cost_absent
    text: |-
      Some cards cannot be played out of faction, and therefore do not have an influence value, which is different from an influence cost of "0". These cards do not have the influence bar at all.
  - rule: rule_alliance
    text: Some Corp cards have the subtype {subtype:alliance} and text defining adjustments to their influence costs. The ability adjusting the influence cost of an {subtype:alliance} card applies only when determining the legality of an already constructed deck and does not have any effect during gameplay. The ability references other cards included in the deck to determine whether the card should apply its printed influence cost or 0 against the deck's influence limit.
  - rule: rule_inf_cost_citation
    text: |-
      {ref:Sec_deck_construction} details how a card's influence cost (or lack thereof) affects deckbuilding.

- section: sec_card_type
  text: Card Type
  rules:
  - rule: rule_type_line_location
    text: |-
      A card's types appear as a line of text across the center of non-ice cards above the text box. For ice, they run along the left side of the text box, rotated 90° from the rest of the text.
  - rule: rule_card_type_list
    text: |-
      Each card has one card type, which can be identity, agenda, asset, ice, operation, upgrade, event, hardware, program, or resource. It is written in bold at the beginning of the type line.
  - rule: rule_card_type_while_inactive
    text: |-
      While inactive, a card is still considered a card of the type printed on it, with the exception of facedown installed Runner cards. See {ref:sec_facedown_runner_cards}.
  - rule: rule_card_type_conversion_citation
    text: |-
      Abilities can change a card from its printed type to an agenda. See {ref:rule_add_card_to_score_area}.
  - rule: rule_card_type_counters
    text: Counters never have card types.

- section: sec_subtypes
  text: Subtypes
  rules:
  - subsection: rule_subtypes
    text: Cards may have one or more subtypes, which are written following the primary type. Subtypes are card descriptors that can be referenced by card abilities. Cards that share a subtype often share a distinct characteristic or ability.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_subtype_special_rules
      text: The subtypes {subtype:region}, {subtype:console}, and {subtype:icebreaker} have special rules, discussed in {ref:subsec_regions,subsec_consoles,subsec_icebreakers} respectively. Other subtypes have no intrinsic rules meaning.
  - rule: rule_subtype_bold
    text: In card text, subtypes are always referenced in bold text. If a word or phrase that is also a subtype appears in a card's text but is not in bold text, that word or phrase does not reference the subtype.
  - rule: rule_lack_of_subtype
    text: Some abilities reference cards by a lack of subtype, such as "non-{subtype:virus}". These abilities can only affect cards that do not have the specified subtype, regardless of any other subtypes the cards do have.
  - rule: rule_subtypes_active
    text: A card has all of its subtypes at all times, even while inactive, with the exception of facedown installed Runner cards. See {ref:sec_facedown_runner_cards}.
  - rule: rule_add_remove_subtypes
    text: |-
      Abilities can add or remove subtypes. The number of times a card has, gains, and loses each subtype is tracked as a running total, but the result is binary: if the total number of instances of the subtype exceeds the number of times it is removed, the card has that subtype. Otherwise, it does not.
    examples: 
    - text: The Runner plays {card:Tinkering} on a {card:Lycan} hosting 1 advancement counter. {card:Lycan} has two instances of {subtype:sentry}, one printed and one from {card:Tinkering}, and has lost one instance of {subtype:sentry} from its own ability. Thus it is still a {subtype:sentry}.
  - rule: rule_choose_valid_subtype
    text: If an effect requires a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose a single subtype that has been printed on at least one card. If a player is required to choose a subtype belonging to a specific card type, they must choose a subtype that has been printed on at least one card with that type.
  - subsection: rule_subtypes_list
    text: Below is a list of all subtypes.
    rules:
    - rule: rule_identity_subtypes

- section: sec_text_box
  text: Text Box
  rules:
  - rule: rule_text_box_definition
    text: |-
      The {term:text box} is the central area on a card containing any abilities the card has. Abilities usually only apply when the card they appear on is active. {ref:Rule_ability_active_inactive_source_card} details exceptions.
  - rule: rule_flavor_text
    text: |-
      Many cards have italicised text written after their game text. This is {term:flavor text}, and has no effect on the game or the function of the card, nor can other abilities reference or interact with it.
  - rule: rule_reminder_text
    text: |-
      Some cards have italicised text in parenthesis. This is {term:reminder text}, and has no effect on the game or the function of the card, nor can other abilities reference or interact with it directly. Reminder text simply summarizes a rule that may apply to that card text.
